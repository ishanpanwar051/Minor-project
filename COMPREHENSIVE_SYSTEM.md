## 🎯 **ENHANCED RISK CALCULATION**

### **Comprehensive Risk Score Algorithm:**
```
Risk Score = (Academic Factors × 40%) + (Personal Factors × 30%) + (Socioeconomic × 20%) + (Environmental × 10%) + Special Factors

Example: Sneha Reddy
- CGPA: 6.2 → 15 points
- Attendance: 65% → 10 points
- Mental Health: 3/10 → 20 points
- Financial Stress: 9/10 → 15 points
- Work Hours: 35/week → 20 points
- First Generation: +10 points
- Learning Disability: +15 points
- Previous Dropout: +25 points
- No Internet: +20 points
TOTAL: 140 → Capped at 100 (HIGH RISK)
```
